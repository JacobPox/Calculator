# Calculator Flask App


Currently, this calculator does not function. I am still working on it.

# To use:

1. Download files to computer
2. Make sure you have Python 3 and an updated Flask
3. Open command line
4. CD into folder where app is held

**For Command Prompt:**
5. set FLASK_APP=calculator.py
6. flask run

**For Power Shell:**
5. $env:FLASK_APP = "hello"
6. flask run

**For Unix Bash ( Linux, Mac, etc):**
5. export FLASK_APP=hello
6. flask run
